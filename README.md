# Cplusplus-Program

**CS-210**

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
**This Project was my final project in my Computer Science Programming Languages Class.
In this project I was required to combine Python and C++. It was a grocery item project.
I had to create a user interface in C++ on what the user wanted to do with a text grocery list.
If the user selected to produce a list of all items purchased in the day it would go through Python
loop through the text file and produce a list of all items and how many were in the list. If the user
chose to look for a certain item they would select that option and type it in. The program then uses Python
to loop through the txt file find the exact string match and print how many times it was in the list. If the 
user wanted to produce a histogram listing they would select that option. The program will then go through Python
loop through the text file and for every duplicate would add an asterick next to the item and finally wrote that 
text file to a .dat file and allowed my C++ program to read it. Finally if the user wished to quit the program they 
could input the button to quit.**

What did you do particularly well?
**I was able to catch all errors very well. Also, the Python code I wrote was very proficient especially the string match
function to capture the exact word a user inputted. Also, looping through every function if a user inputted the wrong 
information worked out well.**

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
**There are a few places I could enhance my code. For security purposes I could've used private class identifiers.
Also, I could have used a switch statement instead of an if statement for optimization.**

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
**The most difficult part I had on my project was exact string match in Python. I had to research exactly how to do it and kept 
utilizing trial and error to get it to function correctly. There are many resources online that I utilize to help me solve my 
programming roadblocks. Sometimes on reddit or sometimes on GitHub.**

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
**Skills from this project that will help me with other projects or coursework include thinking of all possible errors
and accounting for them. Also, writing down exactly what I want my program to accomplish. Finally, constantly compiling
my code to ensure it is working as intended.**

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I used many comments throughout. Also, I tried to keep
the code very simple and not write many lines of code to accomplish one thing.**

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
**I ensure that I gather all relevant information from the clients or stakeholders on what they want in their program. 
I then turn this into User Stories by answering what "type of user", what they "want it to do" and what "goal they want to achieve.**

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
**I approach developing programs by knowing exactly what the user wants in their program. However, one of the most important
agile principle for me to understand is that the project can change at anytime. I will prepare myself by understanding 
that I must be flexible and communicate constantly.**

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
**A good team member works together with all members of their team. They understand the importance of active communication
and that everyone's opinion matters. A good team member works as part of the team and does not try and do everything
how they want and by themselves.**

How do I approach designing software?
**When designing my project for this class I chose multiple models and took a picture of them.  I constantly looked back on the image to ensure my 3D program was looking similar to my 2D image.  Also, when thinking about the lighting and my texture I had to plan what would work well together.  These tactics can be applied in my future work by planning any program I want to develop.  Planning is a crucial role in software developing.**

How do I approach developing programs?
**As for my developing strategies with this project, I ensured all of my code worked properly.  I was constantly testing and changin little variables.  I also put many comments throughout my code.  Throughout the milestones for my project, I constantly improved upon my previous weeks milestone.  I also saved many copies of my project because I kept changing it drastically to get the end product I wanted.  This program had more lines of code, header files, and CPP files then anything I have worked on in the past.  This project helped me understand how to organize it all logically, and how everything works together.**

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
**This class was not only my hardest class in my degree path it was also my most informative.  I had much practice with pointers which I struggle with.  Also, as mentioned, I used many header files and other CPP files and connected them all properly.  I also got much practice with debugging.  This class will help me with my future educational and professional pathway more than any other class has.**

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
**To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable the program needs to be reusable.  This means making a program that uses logic that can be used for many different programs.  Also, proper commenting can help other prgrammers understand what your program is supposed to do.  Finally, creating simple functions that do one thing can be used for anything similar.**

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
**As a computer scientist you first have to plan on how to solve a problem.  You must know what the solution should look like and map out how to get there.  This can be done with pen and paper, or by creating pseudocode.  This project was different than anything I have worked on before.  I used multiple things to develop a full stack application, mongoDB, my CRUD Python module, and my actual project using Dash and Pandas.  It was very interesting and showed me how multiple things can interact with eachother.  To meet client requests in the future I will definately use the Data Aggregation Pipeline to organize databases.**

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
**Computer Scientists solve a problem using technology.  Computer science is very broad, individuals in this field must understand, mathematics, programming languages, embeded systems and many more.  This matters because they work on developing programs for everything from videogames, street cameras, ATMs, phones, computers, airplanes, cars, and many more.  My work on this type of project can help any company.  A database such as the one I worked on had over 10,000 data points. Manually going through each one would take a very long time.  Whereas my program did not take long to develop and was able to organize and display the data in seconds.**
