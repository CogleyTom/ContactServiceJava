# Cplusplus-Program

**CS-210**

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
**This Project was my final project in my Computer Science Programming Languages Class.
In this project I was required to combine Python and C++. It was a grocery item project.
I had to create a user interface in C++ on what the user wanted to do with a text grocery list.
If the user selected to produce a list of all items purchased in the day it would go through Python
loop through the text file and produce a list of all items and how many were in the list. If the user
chose to look for a certain item they would select that option and type it in. The program then uses Python
to loop through the txt file find the exact string match and print how many times it was in the list. If the 
user wanted to produce a histogram listing they would select that option. The program will then go through Python
loop through the text file and for every duplicate would add an asterick next to the item and finally wrote that 
text file to a .dat file and allowed my C++ program to read it. Finally if the user wished to quit the program they 
could input the button to quit.**

What did you do particularly well?
**I was able to catch all errors very well. Also, the Python code I wrote was very proficient especially the string match
function to capture the exact word a user inputted. Also, looping through every function if a user inputted the wrong 
information worked out well.**

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
**There are a few places I could enhance my code. For security purposes I could've used private class identifiers.
Also, I could have used a switch statement instead of an if statement for optimization.**

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
**The most difficult part I had on my project was exact string match in Python. I had to research exactly how to do it and kept 
utilizing trial and error to get it to function correctly. There are many resources online that I utilize to help me solve my 
programming roadblocks. Sometimes on reddit or sometimes on GitHub.**

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
**Skills from this project that will help me with other projects or coursework include thinking of all possible errors
and accounting for them. Also, writing down exactly what I want my program to accomplish. Finally, constantly compiling
my code to ensure it is working as intended.**

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
**To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I used many comments throughout. Also, I tried to keep
the code very simple and not write many lines of code to accomplish one thing.**

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
**The gaming room application required multiple teams to guess what image was being drawn from random stock images. One instance of the game and 
each player is only allowed once, this required the use of singleton classes.**

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
**There were many things I did particularly well. However, understanding the development requirements for each platform and conveying it was what I did the best on.**

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
**Creating the domain model and UML diagram helped the most when developing the code. Understanding how my program was supposed to behave was very important.**

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
**If I had to choose one part to revise it would be the recommendations section. I feel like I could add more data in there and many more comparisons so my client
can understand the differences between the platforms.**

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
**I understood how the user wanted their App to run. I then created my domain model based on what the user wanted, such as, separate teams, 
separate players, and no name the same. It is important to consider the user's need when designing because it is their program. Creating a 
program that accomplishes everything the client wants is how we finish a project.**

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
**I approached the desing aspect by looking through what the client wanted on their App. I then created my UML diagram so I could see the proper flow
of my program. I then began to develop it. In the future I would use the exact same approach to design a software application.**

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
**I ensure that I gather all relevant information from the clients or stakeholders on what they want in their program. 
I then turn this into User Stories by answering what "type of user", what they "want it to do" and what "goal they want to achieve.**

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
**I approach developing programs by knowing exactly what the user wants in their program. However, one of the most important
agile principle for me to understand is that the project can change at anytime. I will prepare myself by understanding 
that I must be flexible and communicate constantly.**

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
**A good team member works together with all members of their team. They understand the importance of active communication
and that everyone's opinion matters. A good team member works as part of the team and does not try and do everything
how they want and by themselves.**
